# RDS_Dataset
RDS dataset proposed in this study initially comprises 275 original images. 
The image dataset utilized in this research was compiled from surveys conducted in multiple underground parking garages located within residential areas in Zhejiang Province, China. These subterranean structures are frequently exposed to a humid coastal environment, which has resulted in extensive concrete degradation, primarily manifested as bump and spalling. Damage was observed on various RC structural elements, including beams, slabs, columns, and walls; these elements consequently served as the subjects for image capture.
While the primary focus of the damage identification task addressed in this paper pertains specifically to defects originating from reinforcement corrosion (i.e., rust-induced spalling and bump), RDS dataset constructed herein features a more detailed categorization than existing publicly available datasets for RC damage segmentation, such as the φ-Net dataset [35]. Specifically, five distinct classes were annotated pixel-wise within the RDS dataset: (1) Background, (2) Structure surface, (3) Spalling, (4) Exposed Rebar, and (5) Bump. In contrast, the φ-Net dataset only provides annotations for Background and a general Damaged Area category.
Crucially, to enhance the robustness of the developed model against variations in environmental conditions, image acquisition was deliberately performed under diverse lighting situations. Data collection encompassed capturing images under both well-lit ambient conditions and challenging dimly lit scenarios characteristic of underground spaces. Furthermore, multiple distinct imaging devices were employed during the data acquisition process. This strategy was implemented to mitigate potential variations in model performance attributable to sensitivity to specific camera hardware. Images within the RDS dataset were manually annotated at the pixel level using LabelMe 5.3.1.
